# Blockly Core Translations

This project has translations for the core components of [Google Blockly][1]
in co-operation with [Code.org][2]. Although Google/Blockly has their own
community translation process, the timeline for Code.org translations is much
shorter and the scope is much broader. This project serves to solve technical
problems and facilitate collaboration. See [cdo-i18n][3] for tech details.
